- 👋 Hi, I’m @DRnerd1
- 👀 I’m interested in: devops and also fullstack development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Golang,
- 👌 I Might Know: Python - for easy scripts, typescript - typiclly for frontend work, bash for better debugin, and lastly some java, c# and a little bit of cpp that i learned to better read logs of big softweres that run on these languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: cool projects that allow devops enjoyers like me to do their work properly
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email my current email ronroitburg@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
```
i am currently honing my skills in python, golang and web develpoment projects that i work on in my spar time.

i made 2 games so far with pygame and one when i was a kid with unity, the first one is scribble - the basic game that you play with friends and guess what they are drawing on the board.
this game made taught me how networking works beyond http traffic. i wrote a complete multiplayer server that allowes as many games to be played at once (at least if i have enough cores 😲)
and to make the actual game i first used tkinter and then rewrote the whole game with pygame, for more control over my components and design.

the second game that i made and the one that i currently work on, is just a basic 2d platformer game that tries to imitate the souls genre, with rolling mechanincs and more.
this is a project that i mainly wanted be pure code withot a real game engine like unity or unreal. i wanted to make a quick game to check and see if i can make physics from scratch, implement basic collisions
and of course optimise all the checks to make the game even playble on a python echo system. for this project i also intend to learn how to use graphics cards instead of cpu's for better in game fps. and in general
just upgrade my tech stack. for this game, instead of using python's tools to create a server like i did in my previous game, i opted to make this a great learning opportunity and start learning concurrency in golang.

in the meantime i am also working on another project that involes typescript and web front develpoment in generl. i already know the basics of react, tailwind css, created some simple ui fronts for my backend work, but i still feal
that i don't know enough about front dev. that's why with this project, which is just creating a personal website and putting inside a lot of useful personal stuff i intend to recreate the whole website with diffrent
frameworks each time, and also imporve my design skills which are currently not that great.

in my current work i am the devops engineer of my company. so with the position i currently hold i also know a lot about k8s managment, docker, cicd "frameworks" like junkins and gitlab cicd and of course bash and linux.
